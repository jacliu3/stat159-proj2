##Conclusions

Though the correlation matrix showed weak relationships between certain features and _Balance_, it seems the best model was still ordinary least squares, which conducts no shrinkage or dimensionality reduction. This is further emphasized in the results of the principal components regression, which choose to retain use `r pcr.best.ncomp` components, equal to the number of features. As mentioned earlier, the coefficients for all five methods were very similar, proving that shrinkage and dimensionality reduction were not significantly beneficial. This suggests that the original data was not highly collinear nor prone to overfitting. However, we must keep in mind that though the methods discussed and demonstrated in this report are very useful, they are limited by their constraint to linear relationships. In many datasets, higher order relationships are common; in that case, other models may be more appropriate. Linear regression models can still be used, but usually requires some sort of feature engineering or use of kernels with the dataset.
