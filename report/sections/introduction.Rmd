###Introduction

Previous we have explored different types of linear regression models, but all were utilizing Ordinary Least Squares method to fit the model. Thus, we want to try and see whether other fitting methods and models will give us better predictions. We will consider the following regression methods:

- Ridge Regression (RR)
- Lasso Regression (LR)
- Principal Components Regression (PCR)
- Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)

We will perform analysis on the data set [Credit](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv). In each analysis, we will tune the parameter(s) for each respective model with 10 fold cross-validation and then evaluate the best models mainly using Minimum Square Errors (MSE) on the test set.
