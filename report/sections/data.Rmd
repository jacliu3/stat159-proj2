Data
____

The primary data set we are using is [Credit](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv), which contains 400 bank customers and their personal information. _Balance_, which states the current balance of the customer, is used as an dependent variable and the rest is used as predictor variables, which includes:

- _Income_: a quantitative variable stating customer's income
- _Limit_: a quantitative variable stating customer's credit limit
- _Rating_: a quantitative variable stating customer's credit rating
- _Cards_: a quantitative variable stating the number of cards that the customer has
- _Age_: a quantitative variable stating customer's age
- _Education_: a quantitative variable stating the number of years of education of the customer
- _Gender_: a qualitative variable stating customer's gender
- _Student_: a qualitative variable stating whether the customer is currently a student
- _Married_: a qualitative variable stating the customer's marital status
- _Ethnicity_: a qualitative variable stating customer's ethnicity

We'll pick the best models with optimal parameters in predicting _Balance_ using the above variables.
